# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is similar to a stack of objects, where you can add or remove items only from the top of the stack.

In a stack, the primary operations are:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Returns the value of the topmost element without removing it.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Think of it as a stack of plates, where you can only add a plate to the top or remove the topmost plate. The last plate you add is the first one you can remove.

The operations of a stack follow a specific order, which ensures that the most recently added item is the first one to be removed. This behavior is why it is called a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the requirements and available resources. However, the basic operations and principles remain the same regardless of the implementation.

Stacks are widely used in various applications, including:

Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
Function call stack in programming languages.
Undo/redo functionality in text editors.
Backtracking algorithms.
Browser history management.
Depth-first search algorithms.
I hope this clarifies what a stack data structure is. Let me know if you have any further questions!
