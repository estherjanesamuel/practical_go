# Go Write Test

> We'll provide you with the code for the tests because we don't want to explain line by line. But your mental model should be that you start little by little and do as many iterations as you need.

> In our case, we're going to do only one iteration: write the test, make sure it fails, and write the code that satisfies the test. When coding on your own, you should start simple and add complexity as you progress.

> From here on, we'll write one test case for each method. But you should write as many tests to your programs as you feel comfortable with, so you can cover both expected and unexpected scenarios. For example, in this case, the error-handling logic is tested.
